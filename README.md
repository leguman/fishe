You find here all the information you need to use and contribute to the FISHE project. If you want to know more about the domain that FISHE implements, please visit the project [wiki](https://github.com/fishe/fishe/wiki) and [website](http://www.fishe.org).

### How to Install FISHE

FISHE is an enterprise application targeting large education institutions with thousands of employees ands students. This kind of application is not easily installed because it needs a set of resources to guarantee its scalability. If you are not a technical person, you will probably have some dificulty to install FISHE dispite our effort to make this process as simple as possible. We recommend you to count on a technical friend to perform a stable and reliable FISHE installation.

#### Downloading the Source Code

For the moment, you have to start from the source code to install FISHE. We do not distribute yet a binary package ready to install. To download the source code you need to install a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) client first. Git is a distributed version control system used to manage FISHE's source code. If you use Windows or Mac, we recommend [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com). If you use Linux, you probably already have a command line Git client.

If you also want to contribute to FISHE, you can download the source code using your favorite IDE. We are going to explain how it is done using [Netbeans](http://www.netbeans.org) in the [contribution section below](https://github.com/fishe/fishe/edit/master/README.md#how-to-contribute-to-the-project).
